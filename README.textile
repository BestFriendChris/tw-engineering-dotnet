h1. Notes on the Code

h2. Code smells

These are code smells that we might want to discuss with the participants

h3. Prices

* The IPrice.GetCharge method could be given a more descriptive name
* The unit tests for the IPrice implementations only cover "normal" cases (no edge cases)
* There are no tests for the frequent renter points in IPrice

h3. Movie

* Movie has a price, as well as a get and set property
* Movie allows a null price

Take a look at MovieTests, there is a Law of Demeter violation :    	
	
	Assert.AreEqual(1, RegularMovieInstance.Price.GetFrequentRenterPoints(1));

This chould be refactored to look like this:

	Assert.AreEqual(1, RegularMovieInstance.GetFrequentRenterPoints(1));
